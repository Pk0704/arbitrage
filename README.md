🎰 Arbitrage Betting Calculator 
Welcome to the Arbitrage Betting Calculator – if you have odds that you want to guarantee a profit on, feel free to run my code and find how to make the maximum no matter what hits!😎

🎯 What is Arbitrage Betting?
It's like having your cake and eating it too. 🍰 It is exploiting the betting ranges when the percentages don't add to 100 so that you make a guaranteed profit no matter what.

🛠️ How Does It Work?
My script takes in the odds from two different outcomes and calculates how much you should bet on each side to guarantee a win. Just plug in the odds, and it’ll do the rest – calculating the optimal bet amounts and showing you the potential profit.

Example
Let's say you’ve got two odds:

Line 1: +990 
Line 2: +200
Our script will tell you exactly how much to bet on each outcome to ensure you get paid the same amount, no matter what happens. 💸
